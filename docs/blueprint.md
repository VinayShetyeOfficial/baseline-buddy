# **App Name**: Baseline Bard

## Core Features:

- Smart Snippet Suggestions: The tool analyzes the developer's code and context to suggest code snippets that are compatible with the baseline features available for the target browser versions.
- Code Compatibility Checks: The tool identifies which browsers are able to support features within provided code snippets, and provides the percentage of users covered for various pieces of code, so that the developer can make compatibility-conscious decisions.
- Interactive Dashboard: Presents compatibility information with interactive graphs and charts that illustrate which baseline features are supported across different browsers and versions, aiding in quick assessments.
- Automated Polyfill Generation: Uses a generative AI tool that automatically generates polyfills for unsupported features in the target browsers based on the baseline data.
- Feature Flag Integration Tool: Facilitates easy integration with feature flag systems, allowing developers to enable or disable code sections based on browser compatibility during runtime.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light grey (#F4F4F5) for a clean, developer-friendly aesthetic.
- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#3498db) to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#f39c12) for CTAs and attention-grabbing details, analogous to blue in the color wheel.
- Body text and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for clear and accessible text.
- Code snippets: Use 'Source Code Pro' monospaced font for code clarity.
- Use clean and consistent icons to represent different browsers, features, and compatibility statuses.
- Layout: A structured layout, that is very similar to modern IDE, should include various sections like code input panel, dashboard and configuration to streamline usage and interpretation.
